# React + Vite

## To Run:

- npm install
- npm run dev

## Notes

- Struggled to finish in 24 hours, complteted the User Management section, and a started work on the expense section
- If I had a few more hours I believe I could have finished it
- Essentially I chose to build a 3 page react project with each functionality on each page
- I Chose to use maps for the data structuring as it allows O(1) data lookup
- My intention was to use the same UUID for a user to map to their expenses to easily identify a user's expenses
- I chose to use Material UI and React styled library to provide ease of UI development
- I used ContextAPI and Hooks for state management
- I kept in mind the reusability of components for multiple functions: IE edit and delete
- I chose Javascript over Typescript because the deadline was extremly tight, and I felt it could make a difference in speed of writing code
